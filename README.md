# Hello world!
This is a little hub for the projects. Make yourself at home and poke things around.

## Metal Map
[Here](https://6lor.github.io/MetalMap.html) you can find a page that is based on the Metal Archives data from USA in 2012. I plan to make this map more interactive, but at this point it shows for the calcualted number of bands per top 200 regions int the united states.

## Fallout Terminal
[Here](https://github.com/6lor/fallout_terminal) you can find a little script that I did to recreate the iconic Fallout Terminal Hacking mini-game. Written purely in python, with uase of couple of libraries.

## QA Debug Py
[Here](https://github.com/6lor/QADebugPy) is another script collection that I use for QA activities - it includes:
- The adb script to install and unistall specified packages on all the connected phones
- Image resizing and stiching tool
- Text formatting tool for the Bugzilla bugs.

## Green Machine
[This](https://github.com/6lor/GreenMachine) is a little project that I did for Instagram post performance, namely to monitor the number of views for the speficied video

## Tag Pool
[This](https://github.com/6lor/tag-pool) project is for Instagram as well, it allows to generate the tag pool for your next picture or video. It allows to randomize and prevent tags from repeating.
