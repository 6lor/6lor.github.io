# Hello world!
This is a little hub for the projects. Make yourself at home and poke things around.

## Metal Map
[Here](https://6lor.github.io/MetalMap.html) you can find a page that is based on the Metal Archives data from USA in 2012. I plan to make this map more interactive, but at this point it shows for the calcualted number of bands per top 200 regions int the united states.
